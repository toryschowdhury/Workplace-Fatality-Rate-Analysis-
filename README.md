# Workplace-Fatality-Rate-Analysis-

I have created both Excel and Power BI reports to analyze the given data in two different
platforms. I believe Power BI can create a better visual representation altogether.
# Excel report:
In this report, I will present an analysis of the provided data using Excel pivot tables and
slicers. I used these features to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
Workplace Fatalities and Injuries: Using the Excel pivot table with slicers program, I found
that the Federal program has the highest rate of workplace fatalities, while California has
the highest number of injuries/illnesses. This information provides valuable insights into
the safety and health of workplaces in these areas.
Years to Inspect and Rate of Fatalities: To explore the relationship between "Average of
years to inspect Each Workplace Once" and "Rate of Fatalities," I evaluated the correlation
coefficient in Excel. The correlation coefficient is 0.122, indicating a weak positive
correlation between the two variables. I used both the correlation matrix and the data
analysis feature to arrive at this conclusion.

Overall, this Excel analysis provides valuable insights into the safety and health of
workplaces in the Federal program and California. The correlation analysis between
"Average of years to inspect Each Workplace Once" and "Rate of Fatalities" shows a weak
positive correlation, suggesting that longer inspection intervals may be associated with a
slightly higher rate of fatalities. This information can be used to inform workplace safety
policies and practices.

# Power BI report:
In this report, I will present a visual analysis of the provided data using Power BI. The data
was first imported, cleaned and transformed in data query to obtain a clean structure for the visual report. Based on the questions given in the project, I created different charts that
fit the scenario the best.
Data Transformation and Cleaning: To create a clear and effective visual report, I first
imported the data and transformed it in data query. I cleaned the data and removed all
unnecessary information to ensure a clean structure.
Visual Report Creation: I have created different charts to analyze the data and present the
results visually.
Donut Chart: To show the relationship between “average years to inspect workplace” and
“rate of fatalities”, I created a donut chart. This chart allows us to quickly see the correlation
between the two variables.

Bar Chart: To show the number of injuries/illness by state, I created a bar chart. This chart
is useful to compare the number of injuries/illnesses across different states.
Funnel Chart: To show which program "state" or "federal" has the highest fatalities, I
created a funnel chart. This chart provides an overview of the fatalities in each program
and allows us to see which program has the highest fatalities.
Slicer: Finally, I created a slicer to show the visual relationship between “years to inspect
each workplace”, “rate of fatalities”, “and number of injuries/illnesses by state”. This slicer
allows us to select either all the states or one or more states to see how the other parameters
relate. The slicer also interconnects with the donut, bar and funnel charts in the report and
shows the interactive relation between the parameters.
Overall, this Power BI visual report is an effective way to analyze the provided data. The
charts and slicer provide a clear and interactive representation of the data, making it easier
to understand the relationships between different parameters.
3 Ideas for future improvement of this project
• Integrating predictive analytics: Incorporating predictive analytics along with the
historical data can provide insights into potential workplace hazards or risks. For
example, using machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of workplace
accidents or injuries based on past incidents, demographic information, and other
relevant data can help organizations reduce the future workplace hazards.
• Expanding data sources: If more than one dataset can be analyzed from additional sources, 
we can get even better insights into workplace safety. For example,
employee surveys or safety audits can be beneficial for better analysis.
• Developing a real time dashboard: Real-time dashboard can display the most
updated data on workplace safety enabling organizations to make quantitative
decisions more promptly.
